With the Connector SDK [0.7.0 release](https://github.com/camunda/connector-sdk/releases/tag/0.7.0), we made
breaking changes to the inbound Connectors. Please update
[HTTP Webhook](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/blob/main/connectors/webhook-connector/element-templates/webhook-connector.json)
and [GitHub Webhook](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/blob/main/connectors/github/element-templates/github-webhook-connector.json)
element templates to the latest versions.

If you have used inbound webhook Connectors with Connector Runtime 0.6.x, you need to **manually**
apply the new element template version to your diagrams:

1. Download the new element template from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/releases/tag/0.17.0).
2. Follow the [installation guide](../../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/configuring-templates.md) to reinstall the element template.
