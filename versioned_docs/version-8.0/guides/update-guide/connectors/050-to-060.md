No manual adjustment necessary to migrate from
[Connector SDK](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md)
0.5.x to 0.6.0.

With SDK version 0.6.0, we introduced the following changes:

- Replacing secrects in parent classes
- Supporting intermediate inbound events
- Defining interfaces for inbound connectors
- Fixing failing datetime serialization
