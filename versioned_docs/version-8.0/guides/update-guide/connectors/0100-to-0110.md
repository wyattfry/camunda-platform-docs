:::note
Migrate directly to version 0.11.2 of the SDK. This contains a fix for several issues in the 0.11.0 release.
:::

This SDK release is not backwards-compatible. We are moving towards a stable Connectors release and continue to improve the experience of developing custom connectors.

In this SDK version, we changed the `OutboundConnectorContext` and `InboundConnectorContext` interfaces significantly. You can no longer use the `getVariablesAsType`.

Use the new `bindVariables` method instead, as it takes care of secret replacement, payload validation, and deserialization automatically.

We are moving away from a mandatory `@Secret` annotation. From this release onwards, secrets are automatically replaced in all input variables/properties without the need to explicitly declare an annotation.

To migrate your Connector implementations, complete the following:

1. If you used the `OutboundConnectorContext::getVariablesAsType` method in you outbound Connector functions, replace it with `OutboundConnectorContext::bindVariables`.
2. Remove calls to the `OutboundConnectorContext::replaceSecrets` method. The secrets are now replaced automatically.
3. Remove calls to the `OutboundConnectorContext::validate` methods. The validation is now performed automatically.
4. If you used the `@Secret` annotation in your Connector implementations, you can safely remove it as it has no effect.
