These documents guide you through the process of updating your Camunda Platform 8
application or server installation from one Camunda Platform 8 version to the other.

:::note
When updating from one minor version to the next, you do not need to update to each **patch** version along the way. However, do not skip **minor** versions when updating.

You can find guides on how to update your Connector runtimes to a newer version of the
[Connector SDK](/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk.md)
in the **Connectors** section.
