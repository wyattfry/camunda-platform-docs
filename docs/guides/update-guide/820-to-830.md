The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Platform 8.2.x to 8.3.0 for each component.

## Zeebe

### Resources no longer available in the Deployment:CREATED event

Resources in the **Deployment:CREATED** event are no longer available. Custom Exporters using the resources from this event must be modified to get them from the **Process:CREATED** event for BPMN models and the **DecisionRequirements:CREATED** event for DMN models.

### Change in monitoring endpoints

There were some changes to the monitoring endpoints of Zeebe, both for the gateway and the broker. All of these were existing redirects to the new endpoints, so their format is left unchanged; only the redirects have been removed.

You may have to change your Kubernetes health probes or metrics scraping endpoints to accomodate the new ones. Note that if you're deploying with the Helm charts, or are using Camunda Platform 8 SaaS, you do not need to do anything.

#### Broker

- The `/metrics` endpoint is now `/actuator/prometheus`

#### Gateway

- The `/metrics` endpoint is now `/actuator/prometheus`
- The `/health` endpoint is now `/actuator/health`
- The `/startup` endpoint is now `/actuator/health/startup`
- The `/live` endpoint is now `/actuator/health/liveness`
